# Emergency Fund Planner

The Emergency Fund Planner is a Python program designed to assist you in analyzing your emergency fund status and planning to achieve your financial goals. This program is an extension of the previous work, "Expense Tracker."

## Assess Your Spending Status

After understanding your spending status, congrats if you are debt-free! You can now move on to the next step: setting up your emergency fund.  

However, if you have debts, prioritize on paying them off before establishing your emergency fund.

## What Is an Emergency Fund?

An emergency fund is money you set aside for lifeâ€™s unexpected expenses, like car repairs, hospital visits, and even job loss. This money gives you the power to hand over cash to cover the big and small surprises that come your way[^1^].

## Why Have an Emergency Fund?

- **Preparedness for Emergencies:** In case of unexpected events, you'll be financially prepared.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have a backup plan for unforeseen circumstances contributes to financial security.

## How Much Should I Save?

### Save 3 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are single with no dependents.
- You are married, and both you and your partner have stable incomes.

### Save 6 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are married with a single income.
- You are a single parent.
- You or your partner has irregular income (e.g., self-employed or freelancer).
- Someone in your home is chronically ill.

These funds should be set aside in an untouchable but easily accessible account, such as a savings account or online bank account.

The program assists in setting up a plan for the 'shortened' amount to guide you on your financial journey.

## Usage Example

### 1. Run the Program:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the Emergency Fund Planner program.
- Execute the program, e.g., by running `python3 emergency_fund_planner.py`.

### 2. Enter Your Name or Use Existing Expenses Dataset:

- When prompted, enter 'test' if using the provided example dataset ('test.csv') or enter your name if you've built your own expenses dataset using the expense_tracker app.

### 3. Provide Your Financial Status:

- The program will ask for your financial status. Enter the number that corresponds to the best description of your situation. 

### 4. Enter Emergency Fund Account Balance:

- If you already have an emergency fund, enter the current balance when prompted. 
- If you don't have one, enter '0'.

### 5. View Emergency Fund Status Plot:

- The program will generate a plot showing your emergency fund status. The plot will be saved locally as .png file and .html for an interactive function.
- The dashed line represents the emergency fund goal. If your balance exceeds the goal, it will be indicated accordingly.

### 6. Plan Creation:

- Based on your status, the program will guide you to create a plan. Follow the instructions to input the necessary details.
- As a result, the program will display the plan you've created. For example:
    - Your PLAN:
      - Save '326' every month for the next 9 months.

### 7. Explanation:

- This program is an extension of the expense_tracker app. The expense_tracker generates a CSV file. The CSV file is then utilized by the Emergency Fund Planner to assist in creating a personalized emergency fund plan.

## Future Plans and Features

The Emergency Fund Planner is part of a larger initiative to build a comprehensive Budget Planning App. The app will not only help you calculate your emergency fund but also assist in planning how much to save each month to reach your financial goals.
