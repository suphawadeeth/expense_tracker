# Emergency Fund Calculator

The Emergency Fund Calculator is a Python program designed to assist you in determining the amount you should set aside for your emergency fund. This program extends from the previous work, "Expense Tracker."

## Assess Your Spending Status

After understanding your spending status, congrats if you are debt-free! You can now move on to the next step: setting up your emergency fund.  

However, if you have debts, prioritize on paying them off before establishing your emergency fund.

## What Is an Emergency Fund?

An emergency fund is money you set aside for lifeâ€™s unexpected expenses, like car repairs, hospital visits, and even job loss. This money gives you the power to hand over cash to cover the big and small surprises that come your way[^1^].

## Why Have an Emergency Fund?

- **Preparedness for Emergencies:** In case of unexpected events, you'll be financially prepared.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have a backup plan for unforeseen circumstances contributes to financial security.

## How Much Should I Save?

### Save 3 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are single with no dependents.
- You are married, and both you and your partner have stable incomes.

### Save 6 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are married with a single income.
- You are a single parent.
- You or your partner has irregular income (e.g., self-employed or freelancer).
- Someone in your home is chronically ill.

These funds should be set aside in an untouchable but easily accessible account, such as a savings account or online bank account.

## Future Plans and Features

This Emergency Fund Calculator is part of a larger initiative to build a comprehensive Budget Planning App. The app will not only help you calculate your emergency fund but also assist in planning how much to save each month to reach your financial goals.
