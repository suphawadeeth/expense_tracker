# Emergency Fund Calculator

The Emergency Fund Calculator is a Python program designed to assist you in determining the amount you should set aside for your emergency fund. This program extends from the previous work, "Expense Tracker."

## Assess Your Spending Status

After understanding your spending status, congratulations are in order if you are debt-free! You can proceed to the next step, which involves setting up your emergency fund. However, if you have outstanding debts, prioritize addressing them before establishing your emergency fund.

## What Is an Emergency Fund?

An emergency fund is money reserved for life's unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical emergencies, or job loss. This fund provides the financial flexibility to handle both major and minor surprises in life[^1^].

## Why Have an Emergency Fund?

- **Preparedness for Emergencies:** In case of unexpected events, you'll be financially prepared.
- **Peace of Mind:** Knowing you have a backup plan for unforeseen circumstances contributes to financial security.

## How Much Should I Save?

### Save 3 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are single with no dependents.
- You are married, and both you and your partner have stable incomes.

### Save 6 Months' Worth of Expenses If:

- You are married with a single income.
- You are a single parent.
- You or your partner has irregular income (e.g., self-employed or freelancer).
- Someone in your home is chronically ill.

These funds should be set aside in an untouchable but easily accessible account, such as a savings account or online bank account.
