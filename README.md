# Expense Tracker
Expense Tracker is a simple Python program designed to empower users to meticulously record every dollar spent on their expenses.

## Why?
The underlying motivation behind developing Expense Tracker is the recognition that effective money management is integral to financial well-being. Often, the primary reason people face financial challenges is due to a lack of proper money management.

Emphasizing the significance of financial planning, Expense Tracker is rooted in the principle that budgeting is among the top 5 habits observed in millionaires.

### The Path to Wealth
Planning your budget serves as a crucial step on the path to wealth. Before amassing a fortune, it is essential to have a clear understanding of your current financial standing.

## Features
Expense Tracker functions by consistently recording your expenses over time and providing insightful analyses of your spending patterns. By summarizing your expenses on a monthly and yearly basis, this program aims to assist you in:

- **Understanding Your Spending Habits**: Gain insights into your financial behavior.
- **Identifying Expense Categories**: Clearly visualize where your money is being allocated.
- **Raising Awareness**: Foster an awareness of your spending habits, serving as the first step towards making informed adjustments.

## How It Works
1. **Input Your Expenses**: Log every expenditure, providing details such as date, description, category, and amount.
2. **Monthly and Yearly Summaries**: Obtain comprehensive breakdowns of your spending at regular intervals.
3. **Visual Analytics**: Utilize graphical representations to better understand your financial trends.

## Future Plans

The next step in this project is to develop a Budget Planning App, which will not only track expenses but also help users plan their budgets effectively. The Budget Planning App will include features such as:

- Income tracking
- Expense categorization
- Budget goal setting
- Real-time tracking against budget goals
- Insights and suggestions for better financial planning

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to help you take control of your finances!

## How to Use

To get started, you can use the example spending record file 'myexpenses.csv' provided in this repository. Simply input 'myexpenses' when prompted for 'Your name:'.

The program allows users to start from zero records, and it will record expenses under their specified name. Since this is designed as a personal expense tracker, it saves data as a CSV file locally on your machine.

**Usage Steps:**
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Expense Tracker program.
3. Input your name when prompted for 'Your name:' to start recording your spending and follow the steps.
   - Alternatively, input 'myexpenses' when prompted for 'Your name:' to use the example spending record to see how this works.
4. Explore the features of the program, analyze your spending habits, and gain insights into your expenses.

## Future Development

The current version of the Expense Tracker is designed for personal use, saving data as a CSV file locally. The next steps in development include connecting to an SQL database for more complex and long-term data storage. Please note that this feature is currently undergoing development and is not yet complete.

Feel free to experiment with the example record and provide feedback or contribute to the ongoing development.
